## Course description
Compulsory course. The aim of the course is to provide post graduate students with practical and generic skills required in research. Items covered in the course are descriptive statistics, effect statistics, validity and reliability, inferential statistics, common parametric and nonparametric statistical tests and multiple regression analysis. The students are introduced to computer statistical analysis in practical computer classes.

## Learning outcomes
That students:

- Understand the basic concepts of statistics and data analysis.
- Can apply basic statistical methods to data analysed in their thesis.
- Can understand and criticize statistical analysis of data in health research.
- Are literate in R.
- Understand the theory behind various statistical calculations, and are able to apply this knowledge in the analysis of data.

## Class and workshop schedule

Class schedule can be seen in the following table. Important dates are marked in blue.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(Week = c(rep(1:3, each = 5), 4, 4),
       Date = c(paste(c(7:11, 14:18, 21:25, 28), 'Feb'), '1 Mar'),
       Day = c(rep(c('Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thur', 'Fri'), 3), 'Mon', 'Tue'),
       `Time slot` = rep('09:10 - 11:30'),
       Location =  c(rep('H-205', 4), rep('H-203', 2), rep('H-205', 4), 'H-203', 'H-204', rep('H-205', 5)),
       Material = c(rep('', 15), 'Final', ''),
       Remarks = rep('', 17)) %>%
  kbl(align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(c(1, 6, 11, 16), bold = T, color = 'white', background = '#6699CC')
```

Workshop schedule can been seen in the following table. **Student's are strongly encouraged to utilize the workshops!**

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(Date = paste(c(7,8, 11, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23), 'Feb'),
       Day = c('Tue', 'Wed', 'Fri', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Man', 'Tue', 'Wed'),
       `Time slot` = rep('12:30 - 14:00'),
       Location = c('H-204', rep('H-203', 3), 'H-204', 'H-203', 'H-204', 'H-203')) %>%
  kbl(align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```
